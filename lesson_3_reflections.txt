1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When we are working on a project in which a large number of people are contributing from around the world and are far apart.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because if that happens then the number of commits will be very large and some features may go online even before they are ready.
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
By making a fork we are able to clone a repository on github's servers and prevent any change on the original.
By clones we clone it locally and then make and push commits.
Branches are used when we want to prevent from making any changes to the master at that point of time.
4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without using git or github we can collaborte onsite but it would be harder to keep track of all the versions and to simultaneously contribute to it. But if you are working alone then it will be a lot easier without git and github.
